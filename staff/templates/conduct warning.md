Hi, this is rage meister from Maus Haus admin.  Unfortunately, I must inform you there have been multiple complaints about your behavior in game and on discord.

This includes:
•    not listening/following orders from squad leaders (both walter and skinny), and otherwise poor teamwork and communication
o    this wastes time and enrages those you are playing with
•    incessantly direct messaging members with invitations to play
o    this is annoying and bad etiquette.  players wishing to squad up will join a voice channel

This has been an ongoing issue for ~2 weeks now, and for this reason we must give you a formal warning to correct your behavior, or face disciplinary action.

Disciplinary action may include, but is not limited to:
•    temporary discord mute
•    temporary/indefinite discord ban
•    removal from in game squadron
and is applied at the discretion of staff.

Maus Haus values all members and considers formal discipline a last resort.  We hope you can take this notice in a constructive manner and resolve the issues we outline above.  If anything I've outlined is unclear, please contact me or another staff member.

Hi, we have removed your account from our squadron due to inactivity in game and failure to join our discord.  If you would like to rejoin, apply for our second squadron [Kg55G] and join our discord [https://discord.gg/WkgJxFk8tz].

If we have removed you in error, please ping walter_94214 on discord.

Please note: we are working on our discord bot to keep track of who has/hasn't joined the discord, until it is operational, we have to verify your account manually, so please make it known to the mods in the discord what your warthunder name is.

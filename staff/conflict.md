The procedure for resolving conflict between members

When a conflict is brought to attention of a staff member, as per the members conflict resolution policy:
1. Where possible, a different staff member should be assigned to speak to each involved member, and document their side
2. An additional staff member should speak to as many witnesses as possible, and document what they saw/heard
3. The assigned staff have a meeting, where they share their findings, and figure out what happened
4. Action is decided on unanimously by the staff members handling the case

Action:
Ban is considered a last resort, and is only used for repeat offenders.  The preference of action goes as follows.  Attempt the next action if the previous was unsuccessful (i.e. the member re-offends)
1. reasoning (this is why you shouldn't do x)
2. arbitrate (don't do x)
3. chat ban or timeout
4. kick
5. ban 



I would like to remind staff the procedure for when they are in conflict with another member: leave the VC / disengage with the chat, document / screenshot what occurred, and submit to myself or my Leutnant @cornndogg "Applejack" sqeekz.  It is important for staff to hold themselves to a higher standard than regular members, and this procedure is to prevent staff from losing their composure in front of regular members, as this complicates disciplinary matters.

rules that will help you keep calm in warthunder

j-out before spawn:
if uptiered against early jets - if they know what they're doing there is no chance you can kill them
if on an "air battle" map in bombers
if your team collapses, bug out
on mozdok in a bomber - fighters catch up too quickly

planes that suck - don't fly them:
typhoon (cannon and mg variants) - horrendous roll rate, cannot conduct BnZ against aware enemies
early spitfires - poor armament, struggles to finish off targets before you get jumped, turn rate not good enough to get guns on quickly

never take headons:
in ju288c

never help a teammate unless you have an escape route - teammate will die 75% of the time

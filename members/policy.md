Activity:
no one will be removed from the discord for any reason other than rule breaking
low activity (in warthunder) may result in your account's removal from the in game squadron to keep the activity high,
	so that other members can receive the full squadron research possible (20k points).  if this
	happens to you, contact staff when you return, and a spot will be made available for you to rejoin.

Conflict Resolution
When you come into conflict with another member: 
1. politely tell them what the issue is and attempt to come to an understanding with each other
2. if (1) was unsuccessful, leave the VC / disengage with the chat, document / screenshot what occurred, and submit to a staff member, preferably one you know/trust
